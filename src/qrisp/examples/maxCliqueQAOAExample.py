"""
This is an example implementation of maxClique Problem instance solved with QAOA
The problem is structured as follows:
> Given a Graph G = (V,E) maximize the size of a clique G (i.e. a subset V' of V, which a subgraph in which all pairs of vertices are adjacent).

We will not stick to mathematical assignment of variable names.
