This is an example of the maxSetPacking QAOA solution
the problem is structured as follows:
> Given a universe [n] and m subsets S (S_j in S, S_j is subset of [n]), find the maximum cardinality subcollection S' (S' is subset of S) of pairwise dijoint sets.

We will not stick to mathematical assignment of variable names.
