     - provides functions for applying diagonal Hamiltonians given by polynomials.
   * - :ref:`Grover's Algorithm <grover_tools>`
     - unstructured search
   * - :ref:`Dicke state preparation <DickeStates>`
     - algorithm for the preparation of Dicke states, i.e. states with a given Hamming weight. 
   * - Iterable :ref:`Demuxing <ItDemuxing>`, :ref:`Shifting <ItShifting>`, and :ref:`Permutation <ItPermutation>`
     - low-level manipulations of quantum arguments like :ref:`QuantumVariable <QuantumVariable>` or :ref:`QuantumArray <QuantumArray>`
   * - :ref:`Prefix arithmetic <prefix_arithmetic>`
     - Several arithmetic functions that allow better control over precision and output types than the infix version.


We encourage you to explore these algorithms, delve into their documentation, and experiment with their implementations.
